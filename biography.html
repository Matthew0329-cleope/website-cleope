            <p>My childhood was fun because all I thought about was playing. I loved basketball, and my only dream was to become a basketball superstar. During elementary, I was part of our school varsity team from Grade 3 to Grade 6. Even though I was addicted to basketball, I never dropped out of the first section, which I think was something to be proud of. However, I never received any academic awards because I did not participate in academic activities, only basketball. I was a shy kid who never wanted to recite during discussions, and I did not really focus on studying, I just did the requirements to pass.</p>

            <p>During high school, I had no idea what to expect, but I immediately felt the pressure. My dream of becoming a basketball superstar did not change. However, this time, I learned to balance academics and basketball. I gained confidence and started performing better in class, which I think was because of the pressure I felt. Even though high school was stressful, it was still fun. There were many activities like festival dance, hip-hop, and sabayang pagbigkas. I was surprised that I participated in all of them without thinking I could. I had many first-time experiences in high school, making it very memorable.</p>

            <p>Now that I am in college, I am taking the BSIT program, which surprised me because I never thought about choosing this course. My first choice was nursing, but I was forced to take this program instead. During my first year, I felt both nervous and excited. I heard that college was really difficult and that the reality of life starts here. People also said that college life is fun. My first year was fun because I met new people. I made new friends, and we did many things to make our college life memorable.</p>
