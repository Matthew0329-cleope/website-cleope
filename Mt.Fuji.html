        <p>Mount Fuji, highest mountain in Japan. It rises to 12,388 feet (3,776 metres) near the Pacific Ocean coast in Yamanashi and Shizuoka ken (prefectures) of central Honshu, about 60 miles (100 km) west of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area. It is a volcano that has been dormant since its last eruption, in 1707, but is still generally classified as active by geologists. The mountain is the major feature of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park (1936), and it is at the centre of a UNESCO World Heritage site designated in 2013.</p>
    
        <h3>How to Get There</h3>
        <p>To get to Mount Fuji from the Philippines, fly from Manila (MNL), Cebu (CEB), or Clark (CRK) to Tokyo, Japan, via Narita (NRT) or Haneda (HND) Airport. From Tokyo, the fastest way is to take the JR Limited Express Fuji Excursion from Shinjuku Station to Kawaguchiko Station (~1 hr 50 min, ¥4,000/₱1,500). Another option is to take the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) from Tokyo Station to Mishima Station, then a bus to Kawaguchiko (~2 hrs, ¥6,000/₱2,200). The cheapest route is the Highway Bus from Shinjuku Station to Kawaguchiko Station (~2 hrs, ¥2,000/₱750). From Kawaguchiko Station, visitors can take a bus or taxi to Mount Fuji’s 5th Station (Yoshida Trail) for climbing or explore nearby attractions like Chureito Pagoda, Lake Kawaguchi, and Oshino Hakkai.</p>
